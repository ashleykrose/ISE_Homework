Garlic Grilled Cheese
1) Put garlic butter on both slices of bread on both sides
2) Add favorite type/types of cheese to the bottom slice of bread (I typically put a few different kinds of cheese)
3) Put top slice of bread on top of cheese
4) Grill sandwich until both sides are a light golden brown with the cheese in the middle melted.
